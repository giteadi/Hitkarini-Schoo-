              Hitkarini Girls School, originally established in 1938, began its journey as a boys' school in Dixitpura, Jabalpur. The founding of this institution was driven by a vision to provide quality education to the youth of the region. However, as the need for female education became increasingly apparent, the school underwent a significant transformation in 1942, evolving into a girls' school. This pivotal change was inspired by the growing recognition of the importance of educating girls and providing them with equal opportunities for learning and personal development.

              The transition marked a new era for the institution, aligning with broader societal shifts towards gender equality and women's empowerment. In 1976, the school was renamed "Babu Manmohan Das Hit Kanya Uchchatar Madhyamik Vidyalaya" to honor the legacy of its founder, Babu Manmohan Das, whose dedication to educational excellence laid the foundation for the school’s continued success. Under his visionary leadership, the school expanded its curriculum and resources to meet the evolving needs of its students.
